# Software
At the moment I mainly develop packages written in [Julia](www.julialang.org)


* A generic deconvolution package called [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) written in Julia. The gradient step is calculated using automatic differentation (Zygote.jl) and the deconvolution is able to run on CPU and GPU.
* [FourierTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/FourierTools.jl/) which is a collection of tools and several algorithms working in Fourier space.
* [PhysicalOptics.jl [WIP]](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PhysicalOptics.jl) which allows to write down scalar wave propagation which can be automatic differentiated (AD) by Julia's AD.
