# Software

I want to create sophisticated, well tested and documented software packages for scientific applications.
See my [GitHub](https://github.com/roflmaostc).


At the moment I mainly develop packages written in [Julia](https://www.julialang.org).

* [RadonKA.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/RadonKA.jl): A Julia CPU and CUDA implementation for the (exponential) Radon transform.
* [WaveOpticsPropagation.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/WaveOpticsPropagation.jl): Differentiable wave propagation
* The Julia implementation of [PtyLab](https://github.com/PtyLab/PtyLab.jl)
* A generic deconvolution package called [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) written in Julia. The gradient step is calculated using automatic differentation (Zygote.jl) and the deconvolution is able to run on CPU and GPU.
* [FourierTools.jl](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/FourierTools.jl/) which is a collection of tools and several algorithms working in Fourier space.
* [PhysicalOptics.jl [WIP]](https://github.com/JuliaPhysics/PhysicalOptics.jl) allows to calculate scalar wave propagation which can be automatic differentiated by Julia's AD. 
* [Scalable Angular Spectrum Method](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/Scalable-Angular-Spectrum-Method-SAS)
* Several small packages. You can find them on [GitHub](https://github.com/roflmaostc).
* [BioNanoimaging](https://github.com/bionanoimaging/)

## TVAM Software
* [SwissVAMyKnife.jl](https://github.com/EPFL-LAPD/SwissVAMyKnife.jl): Optimization of TVAM patterns
* [Dr. TVAM](https://github.com/rgl-epfl/drtvam): A Mitsuba based Python package for the optimization of TVAM patterns.

I had a short but intense Django+Python adventure to develop the webpage for [Orpheus e.V.](https://www.orpheus-verein.de).
Also, in my undergrad I enjoyed coding in [OCaml](https://github.com/roflmaostc/99-OCaml-Problems).
