I'm currently a photonics master student at the [Microscopy department of the Leibniz Institute of Photonic Technology in Jena](https://nanoimaging.de) and [K|Lens GmbH](https://www.k-lens.de/) under the joint supervision of [Rainer Heintzmann](https://sites.google.com/site/heintzmann/) and [Ivo Ihrke](manao.inria.fr/perso/~ihrke/wordpress/).



In 2019 I finished two bachelor's degrees in Physics and Informatics at the [Technical University of Munich](www.tum.de). My informatics thesis was about
[Light Field Microscopy](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1543570) in the [Computational Imaging and Inverse Problems research group](https://ciip.in.tum.de/).
My bachelor's thesis in physics was about [Schlieren and Shadowgraphy Imaging studies](https://felix.sumpi.org/bachelor_thesis_felix_wechsler_physics.pdf)at the [Max Planck Institute for Physics](https://www.mpp.mpg.de/forschung/neue-technologien/awake-beschleunigung-mit-plasmawellen).


## Current Projects 
* A generic deconvolution package called [DeconvOptim.jl](https://github.com/roflmaostc/DeconvOptim.jl) written in Julia. The gradient step is calculated using automatic differentation (Zygote.jl) and the deconvolution is able to run on CPU and GPU.
* My master thesis is about a kaleidoscopic multi view microscope.
